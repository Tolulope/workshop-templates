# Running Engaging Workshops for Beginners
_A workshop to level up your workshops_

### First Thoughts

##### What do you think when you walk into a workshop room?
- Who is this?
- Am I qualified for this? Is this valuable for me?
- What do I do if I have questions?
- What are they going to talk about?
- I wonder what’s for dinner…

##### Make the environment welcoming
- My name is Arielle. I'm a developer advocate engineer at Spotify and a former serial hacker in the North American hackathon circuit.
- This is an interactive workshop. If you see a coloured slide, follow the instructions.
- I will answer questions at the end, but please raise your hand if you have a burning question!

### Let's Talk About Workshops

##### What makes a hackathon workshop different?
- 30-60 minutes
- Motivation to “complete” a project
- 24-48 hour timeline
- Abundance of mentorship
- Learning and experimenting mindset

##### Hackathon Tips
- Attendees should walk away with something that works
- Make yourself available after the workshop
- Provide inspiration for projects
- Give some possible “Next steps”

##### Teaching Guidelines
- Present with all learning types in mind (visual, auditory, learn by doing)
- Have real-time mentorship available
- Offer pauses

### Designing for Beginners

Extract away technical details

##### Roadbumps for Beginners
- “This is way over my head”
- Development environment setup
- Small technical errors
- Uninspiring content

##### "This is way over my head"
- Scoping Your Workshop
    - Too broad: "Front end web development", "iOS"
    - Scoped and actionable: “Make a static personal website with Github Pages”, “Learn about audio analysis with the Spotify API”, “Read realtime data from Twitter in Python”
- Minimum Viable Workshop Topic
    - Limited prior knowledge
    - Attendees can walk away with something that works
    - Room for further exploration
- Start Non-Technical
    - __Interactive:__ https://pokeapi.co/
    - Try getting data for another Pokemon! 

##### Development environment setup
- Common problems:
    - (Using TextEdit) “Why isn’t my code coloured like yours?” 
    - “How do I open Terminal?”
    - “It says npm: command not found”
    - “How do I do that on Windows?”
- Keep it environment-agnostic
- Example environments
    - Glitch (front end or Node)
    - Cloud9 (full ubuntu environment)
    - Codepen
    - JSFiddle
    - GitHub (if your audience already has accounts & knows Git)

##### Small technical errors
- Provide a working foundation
    - If you're building from scratch with no reference point, small errors are inevitable. They will demotivate your attendees.
- Good Templates
    - Offer inspiration (ie. a README with things to try)
    - Documented (comments, links to resources, highlights important parts)
    - Hackable (change something small and see different results)
    - Open (accessible during and after event, open-source)
- __Interactive:__ https://hackcon.glitch.me
    - “Remix” the project. Follow the instructions in the README!

##### Uninspiring content
- Make it interactive
- Focus on exploring what you can do
    - If beginners are motivated to create something, they learn the details of how to do it as a side effect.
